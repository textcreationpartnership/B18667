            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the Free-Shipwrights OF <hi>ENGLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>IN the Year</hi> 1605, <hi>after deliberate Consideration of the then Lord High Admiral of</hi> England, <hi>and the Principal Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Commissioners of the Navy, and the then</hi> Master-Builders, <hi>and other Skillful</hi> Master-Shipwrights, <hi>all Persons, being</hi> English Shipwrights <hi>and</hi> Calkers, <hi>were by Charter Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated by the Name of</hi> Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Accommodation of</hi> English Navigation, <hi>and Safety</hi> Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, <hi>were Impowered to practise their Trade in all Rivers and Ports of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales. <hi>And in the Year</hi> 1612, <hi>at the Desire of the said Company, that Charter was Renewed to them with Amendments, by the Name of</hi> The Company of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights of <hi>Rederiff,</hi> in the County of <hi>Surry, and had the same Power of Practising their Trade in all Rivers and Ports of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales, <hi>Continued to them: And for their better Government, Forty four Rules and Ordinances were by them Prepared and Approved of, and Signed by the then Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and Lord Chief Justice of either Bench, agreeable to a Statute of the</hi> 19th. <hi>of</hi> Henry VII. <hi>in that behalf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The first Intent of Incorporating the</hi> Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> England <hi>was for a Nursery, to Encourage a Number of Able and Skillful Workmen in that Art and Mystery, on whom Relies the Performance of Workmanship in Building, Repairing, and Fitting out of Ships and other Vessels (and more especially their Majesties Royal Navy) at times of the greatest Exigency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The said Company was Impowered from time to time to Advise, Consult and Settle General Rules in Marine Architecture, wherein the Consideration of Surveys chiefly depend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>That at the Renewing the aforesaid Charter in</hi> Anno 1612, <hi>it was observed, that many Abuses and Frauds had been Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Admeasurement of Ships, and other Vessels, when it was left to the single Opinion of Private Persons; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Admeasurement of the Ships and other Vessels was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in the Company of</hi> Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> England, <hi>and their Deputies, in the Out-Ports, and Successors for ever, to Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Length of the Keel, and all other Points of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in Order to Cast up their Burthen of Tuns, nearest the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>A Regular Company of</hi> Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> England <hi>was also Intended for the Encouragement of the Breed of that Trade, To Relieve and Maintain their Disabled Cripples and Superannuated Members, of which Number, some in their Youths, and others in their Old Age, by Falls and Bruises, with other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that often happen (since the Encrease of Ships of great Burthen) as well in the Royal Navy Service, for the Defence and Security of these their Majesties Kingdoms, as in Merchants Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for the Benefit of Trade, and Encrease of Navigation, are Objects of Pity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT SO IT IS,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The said Company of</hi> Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> England <hi>for many years (at their great Cost) have endeavoured to put the Powers Granted to them in Execution, but have continually been Impeded by Persons of the same Profession, who, on pretence of Privilege Claimed by Shopkeepers and other Inland Trades, shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Sea-Port Towns, and particularly</hi> New-Castle, <hi>on the River</hi> Tyne, <hi>which River is Described by this Map, shewing how the</hi> Masters <hi>of</hi> Ships, <hi>and the Members of the Company of</hi> Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> England <hi>are Used and Treated by the</hi> Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> New-Castle, <hi>on pretence of Custom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>North <hi>and</hi> South Sheelds <hi>being the usual Places where Ships of great Burthen Ride, and Five or Six Hundred Sail are often there at Anchor together, who have all, or most of them, one or more</hi> Shipwrights <hi>on board, yet on Extraordinary Occasions (or in case a Ship happens to become a Wreck) the</hi> Free-Shipwrights <hi>of</hi> England <hi>are not admitted to Work in that River, nor to Help or assist each other, out of their own respective Ships; but the Masters of Ships are oftentimes Compelled to send to</hi> New-Castle <hi>(Six or eight Miles distance) for</hi> Shipwrights <hi>Free of that Trade, and are Fined and Imprisoned if they act to the contrary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which, on Behalf of the said Company, as also the great Decay, and almost Total Loss of the Breed of Able and Skillful Workmen, to the Art and Mystery of a Shipwright, at this time so much wanting, is humbly submitted to Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
